Welcome to Autorun's documentation!
===================================
**Autorun** is a tool that allows you to send jobs to a remote
computer without having to set up a server (like a sane person would
normally do). The jobs are submitted via Google Drive and
downloaded/executed by the host computer. Output is then sent back
to a Google Drive folder for the user. Check out the :doc:`usage`
section for detailed steps to use Autorun.

The code for this project is available on `Github <https://github.com/chrismathew05/autorun>`_.
